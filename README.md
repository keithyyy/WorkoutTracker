When you navigate to the site, you will be able to view the most recent workout you have recorded. If it's your first time, you'll be able to record your very first one.

Clicking on `New Workout` will prompt you with options of what kind of workout you did; either cardio or resistance.

After filling out the form with the information related to your workout, it'll be saved where you can see it on your dashboard. As well as having it appear on the home page under **Last Work**.

Clicking `Dashboard` will direct you to a stats page where your previous workout information will be displayed through a series of graphs.

To fix - it seems to not recognize the duration data. Under stats.js, console logging the duration data always results in undefined.
